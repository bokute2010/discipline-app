Here’s a checklist of test cases for an authentication feature using AWS Cognito, covering sign-in, sign-up, and reset password processes. The user can sign in using either email or username:

### 1. **Sign-up Tests**

**1.1 Basic Functionality**
- [x] Verify that a user can successfully sign up with a valid email and password.
- [x] Verify that a user can successfully sign up with a valid username and password.
- [x] Verify that an email confirmation is sent after a successful sign-up.

**1.2 Validation Tests**
- [x] Verify that sign-up fails when an invalid email format is entered.
- [x] Verify that sign-up fails if the password does not meet the required criteria (e.g., length, special characters, etc.).
- [x] Verify that the sign-up fails if the username is already taken.
- [x] Verify that sign-up fails if the email is already registered.
- [x] Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed when the required fields are empty.

**1.3 Confirmation Code Tests**
- [x] Verify that a user can successfully confirm sign-up using the correct code.
- [x] Verify that sign-up confirmation fails when an incorrect or expired confirmation code is used.
- [x] Verify that a user cannot sign in until their account is confirmed.
- [x] Verify that a user can request to resend the confirmation code.


### 2. **Sign-in Tests**

**2.1 Basic Functionality**
- [ ] Verify that a user can successfully sign in with a valid email and password.
- [ ] Verify that a user can successfully sign in with a valid username and password.

**2.2 Validation Tests**
- [ ] Verify that sign-in fails with an incorrect password.
- [ ] Verify that sign-in fails with an unregistered email/username.
- [ ] Verify that sign-in fails when using an empty email/username or password field.
- [ ] Verify that a locked account cannot be used to sign in (if account lockout policy is enabled).
- [ ] Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed for invalid credentials.

**2.3 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- [ ] Verify that if MFA is enabled, the user is prompted to enter the OTP after providing valid credentials.
- [ ] Verify that sign-in fails if an incorrect OTP is entered.
- [ ] Verify that a user can successfully complete sign-in by entering the correct OTP.

### 3. **Reset Password Tests**

**3.1 Request Reset**
- [ ] Verify that a user can request a password reset using a valid email.
- [ ] Verify that a user can request a password reset using a valid username.
- [ ] Verify that a password reset request fails for unregistered emails/usernames.
- [ ] Verify that a reset password email is sent upon a successful request.

**3.2 Reset Code Validation**
- [ ] Verify that a user can reset the password using the correct reset code.
- [ ] Verify that resetting the password fails if an incorrect or expired code is used.
- [ ] Verify that a user can request to resend the reset code.

**3.3 Reset Password Process**
- [ ] Verify that a user can set a new password that meets the criteria.
- [ ] Verify that a user cannot reuse their old password (if such a policy is in place).
- [ ] Verify that a user can sign in with the new password after successfully resetting it.
- [ ] Verify that a user cannot sign in with the old password after a successful reset.

### 4. **Additional Tests**

**4.1 Rate Limiting and Security**
- [ ] Verify that rate limiting is enforced after a certain number of failed sign-up/sign-in attempts.
- [ ] Verify that CAPTCHA is displayed after multiple failed sign-up/sign-in attempts (if applicable).
- [ ] Verify that account lockout occurs after a specific number of failed sign-in attempts (if applicable).
- [ ] Verify that password reset links/codes expire after a predefined time period.

**4.2 User Experience**
- [ ] Verify that all error and success messages are displayed correctly to the user.
- [ ] Verify that the user is redirected appropriately after successful sign-in/sign-up/reset.
- [ ] Verify that loading indicators or messages are shown during async operations (e.g., sign-in, sign-up, reset password).

**4.3 AWS Cognito-Specific Tests**
- [ ] Verify that the user pool settings (password policy, attributes, MFA, etc.) are correctly configured.
- [ ] Verify that the correct AWS Cognito triggers (e.g., PreSignUp, PostConfirmation) are working as expected.
- [ ] Verify that all required attributes are correctly stored in the Cognito user pool after sign-up.


### 5. **Resend Code Tests**

**5.1 Sign-up Confirmation Resend**
- [ ] Verify that a user can request to resend the sign-up confirmation code after a failed initial attempt.
- [ ] Verify that the resend confirmation code request succeeds when using a valid email or username.
- [ ] Verify that an error message is displayed when trying to resend the code for an unregistered email/username.
- [x] Verify that the resend confirmation code is delivered to the user’s email within the expected time frame.
- [x] Verify that rate limiting is enforced for resend requests to prevent abuse.
- [ ] Verify that a user can successfully confirm their sign-up with the newly received code.

**5.2 Password Reset Resend**
- [ ] Verify that a user can request to resend the password reset code if the initial attempt fails.
- [ ] Verify that the resend reset code request works with a valid email or username.
- [ ] Verify that an error message is displayed when attempting to resend the reset code for an unregistered email/username.
- [ ] Verify that the resent reset code is delivered to the user’s email promptly.
- [x] Verify that rate limiting is enforced for password reset code resends.
- [ ] Verify that a user can successfully reset their password using the newly received reset code.
